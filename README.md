Java program that simulates the popular blackjack card game

## How It Works
Blackjack is a game that involves the player and the dealer. At the beginning of the round the player is asked to bet a certain amount of money. Once the bet is made, both the dealer and the player are dealt two cards. Once the player sees their hand, they are asked to hit (draw a card) or stay (keep hand).
